Overview
Hunger Warriors is a project inspired by the second Sustainable Development Goal, ZERO HUNGER. This initiative aims to combat hunger by connecting donors with volunteers to distribute excess food effectively.

Users
The system caters to two main user groups:

Donors: Individuals or organizations who have excess food to share.
Volunteers: People who facilitate the collection and distribution of food.
Features
User Authentication: Donors and volunteers can register and log in to the system.
Food Collection: Donors can offer excess food through the platform. Volunteers collect this food from the donors.
Food Assessment and Distribution:
Edible Food: Delivered to homeless individuals or those in need.
Non-Edible Food: Provided to animals, such as strays.
Rewards System: Donors receive rewards for their contributions to the cause.
Workflow
Donors register and provide details about the excess food.
Volunteers receive this information and collect the food.
After inspection, volunteers decide whether the food is suitable for humans or animals.
Based on the food quantity and condition, distribution is carried out.
Donors are rewarded for their contributions.
Objective
Our mission is to reduce food wastage and fight hunger by creating a seamless system that connects those with excess food to those in need, both humans and animals.
